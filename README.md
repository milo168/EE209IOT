## Abstract
**TODO:** IoT security has become increasingly important as many of these embedded devices capture sensitive data and may even do computation on the spot. Through indirect measurements, it is possible to retrieve sensitive data and its computed results. One such side-channel attack is to measure the power consumption during operation. Certain operations have different power signatures (floating point vs integer operations) and so it is possible to figure out what operation is being done.

## Tasks
- [ ] 1/28 Deadline for website w/ detailed proposal, timeline, and reference paper
- [ ] Wk. 4 Chip Whisperer hands-on training and tutorials
- [ ] Wk.5-7 Recreate ‘Floating-Point Multiplication Timing Attack on Deep Neural Network’
- [ ] Wk. 7-10 Expand and further develop experiment
- [ ] Wk. 10 Create and practice final presentation. Finalize report (site)
